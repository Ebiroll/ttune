version 0.2.0 to 0.2.1 (20 Mar 2009):
  * Implemented scissoring for 1 scissor rectangle

version 0.2.0 (20 Jan 2008):
  * Fixed a bug where rotation in the paint-to-user matrix broke radial
    gradient fill.

  * vgCreateContextSH interface changed to allow for specification of
    surface width and height

  * new extension: vgResizeSurfaceSH to be called whenever the surface
    needs to be resized to match the new window size

  * #define GL_GLEXT_LEGACY in shExtensions.h prior to including gl.h
    so it doesn't include glext.h automatically, which enables us to
    check for OpenGL version and define OpenGL extension functions
    manually.

  * Optimized image uploading by replacing the call to gluBuild2DMipmaps
    with glTexImage2D and changing the filter used to GL_LINEAR

  * Added detection of ARB_texture_non_power_of_two extension to upload
    rectangular images directly instead of scaling them and loosing
    precision

  * Pattern paint implemented

  * Include folder changed to "vg" (lowercase)

  * Added a message to test_blend program to notify the user that it
    has not been implemented yet (black screen is therefore fine)

  * All the calls to glLoadMatrix replaced with glPushMatrix,
    glMultMatrix, glPopMatrix.

  * Replaced images used in example programs for royalty-free

  * README file written
